 <h1 style="color: #3c3cc5; font-family: Futura;"> Welcome to your thrilltracker! </h1>
<h2> We're similar to logrides except free and we have a more advanced credit system </h2>

<p style="font-size: 25px;font-family: Futura;"> coaster credit is a concept that was created by the ancient thoosies. But I always felt like I could build on the idea. So I decided to revamp the system and create this website as a guide and tracker to the new thrilltracker system. For example: Nemesis reborn at alton towers: with old coaster credit, all coasters earn you 1 credit. But with thrilltracker, nemi is worth 6: inverted models are worth baseline 2 credits, with an added 4 for each inversion. I find this system much fairer as you now no longer get the same credits from The Smiler and Octonautsâ€™ Rollercoaster Adventure. </p>
